# JPA CRUD PROJECT

  
### Description

  This is a CRUD functional site that uses a databases consisting of various Brazilian jiu-jitsu submissions. One of the things I miss the most since starting Skill Distillery is doing jiu-jitsu, so when thinking about a a possible topic to build a database around it was one of first things thats came to mind.
    The site's homepage displays all of the submissions currently in the database, with an additional link at the top if the page that directs the user to a form where they can input information to build and submit their own submission. From there a page informs the user if there addition was successful and provides a link for the user to get back to the home page. When selecting one of the submissions from the home page the user is presented with details of that specific submission as well as a diagram and a link to tutorial page if there is one connected to that submission. (Not all of the base submissions include images or links, but most do.) On this same page the user has the option to update or delete the submission they are viewing. If updating, they are taken to a separate page to add or change information about that submission.

### Thoughts For The Future

There where a lot of features and design elements that I wanted to include and refine but simply didn't have enough time this first run through. Fully planning on coming back and continuing to work on and update this project. During this project I was able to connect a few dots regarding Spring Boot, and became much more comfortable with working with and implementing JSP pages for various aspects of my site.
